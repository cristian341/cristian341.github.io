                <p>I’m Ben, a musician based in south Derbyshire (UK Midlands).
                    Music began for me when I was 4 years old. I count myself lucky and so grateful to my parents who encouraged me to learn the piano at that age as it has become a passion I couldn’t imagine life without.
                    My education and technical training as a Classical musician with the ABRSM (Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music) led me to achieve Grade 8 piano Distinction, a Diploma in Piano Music Performance and a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Music & Management Sciences at the University of Southampton. My interest in Jazz & Contemporary music led me to expand my repertoire and extend my performances of these musical genres at Weddings and other special social & corporate events. As violinist also, my experience performing with orchestras in Milton Keynes and Derbyshire led my background interest in orchestral works and compositions.
                    Since 2001, as a musician I have been performing to audiences in town halls, theatres and concert halls across the UK including the Royal Albert Hall & Royal Festival Hall in London, Birmingham Symphony Hall, along with other venues Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire, Derbyshire, Greater Manchester, Hampshire, Leicestershire, Northamptonshire and Somerset. I have performing overseas too in Austria (Salzburg), Italy (northern region of Val D’Aosta, and southern region of Puglia) and Malaysia (Kuala Lumpur). In 2004, a personal highlight was performing Edvard Grieg’s piano concerto in A minor with full backing of an Orchestra of 40 musicians.
